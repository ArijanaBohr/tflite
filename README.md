Tutorial on how to convert Tensorflow model to Tensorflow lite in order to run Tensorflow code on the IOT.

Five steps: [tfliteIOT.pptx](https://github.com/ArijanaBohr/tflite/files/8524561/tfliteIOT.pptx)

Step 1: Create Model

Step 2: Save Model

Step 3: Convert Model from Tensorflow to Tensorflow lite

Step 4: Get Code to the IOT

Step 5: Run Inference Model (use run_Inference.py)


Files:
Five_step_example/my_model: this is the saved model of the "Five_step_example"

Five_step_example.py: this is the example code. This is a very simple neural network

saved_Five_step_example.tflite: This is the tflite file that was converted from Tensorflow to Tensorflow lite as seen in the tfliteIOT.pptx

run_inference.py: this is the code to run an inference model on the IOT using the .tflite file
